        <div class="info">Museum of Death is a museum with locations on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles,
            and New Orleans. It was established in June 1995 by J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz with the museum's
            stated goal being "to make people happy to be alive".<p></p>

            The museum was originally established in 1995 in San Diego, in a building the owners claimed was the
            city's first mortuary. It began as a hobby of the founders J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz. They would
            write to serial killers they were interested in, and then show off the artwork their pen pals had created
            once a year at a specialist show. In 1995, after a few years of exhibitions, the collection, and many other
            materials, were made into a museum.
            <p></p>
            In late 1999, the couple attempted to acquire a large amount of materials from the Heaven's Gate cult
            suicides. Although they had been able to purchase many items prior to the main police auction, their
            interest in buying enough merchandise to recreate the scene in its entirety, led to enormous press interest
            and publicity. They were subsequently evicted by their landlord, and moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los
            Angeles</div>
