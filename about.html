        <div class="mayorinfo">LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
            New Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. As the first black woman to hold the post and
            a Democrat, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.<p></p>
            In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District
            B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election, candidate
            Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.
            Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.
            <p></p>
            As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill
            banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
            service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

        <div class="aboutinfo">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of
            New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the
            day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one
            major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
            elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events
            occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them
            masquerade balls).
            <p></p>
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
            earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well
            known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
            naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
            naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
            African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
            are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the
            same parade schedule and route each year.</div>
